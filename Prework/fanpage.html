        <h3>Quick About: </h3>

        <p>

            A Ska band from California, Reel Big Fish rose to fame with the late 90's Ska wave! They continued their success even after the loss of mainstream attention, due to an empassioned fan base. Since then, the band has continued making music based around their passion! Although many original members have since left, the torch is kept alive by the fan base and the last original member, Aaron Barrett.
